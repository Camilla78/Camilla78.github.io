		 <br>
		 <p7>I am currently enrolled at Montgomery College, majoring in Graphic Design. As a student and a designer, I'm always looking for ways to continue growing and creating. Designing will always have a it's complex challenges, creating a simple solutions is what keeps me motivated. Every little detail matters, for it's like putting together the perfect outfit.
		
		<br>
		On my off days, I'm usually roaming around the city. The city has a great way of always inspiring me. From the metro ride, to the people, the museums, restaurants (my favorite), and so on. I like to keep busy, and when I'm ready to just unwind, the beach is where I'll be heading.
